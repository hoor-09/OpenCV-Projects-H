# 🖼️ OpenCV Projects
=======


A collection of Computer Vision projects built using **OpenCV** and **Python**.  
Each project explores a different aspect of image processing, object detection, or real-time computer vision applications.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 [Project-01: Hand Car Game](./Project-01-HandCarGame)
Control a car game using hand gestures detected via OpenCV.

### 🔹 [Project-02: Object Detection](./Project-02-ObjectDetection)
Detect and track objects in real-time using OpenCV.

### 🔹 [Project-03: Air Canvas Ultra Pro](./Project-03-AirCanvasUltra_Pro)
Draw in the air using hand gestures, turning your hand into a virtual paintbrush.

### 🔹 [Project-04: HandBot](./Project-04-HandBot)
A hand-controlled bot system powered by gesture recognition.

### 🔹 [Project-05: Sign Language Translator](./Project-05-signLanguageTranslator)
Translate basic sign language gestures into text.

### 🔹 [Project-06: Robot](./Project-06-Robot)
Computer vision-powered robotic controls and automation.

### 🔹 [Project-07: Invisibility Cloak](./Project-07-InvisibilityCloak)
A Harry Potter–style invisibility effect using color detection and masking.

### 🔹 [Project-08: Table Hockey](./Project-08-TableHockey)
A computer vision–powered air hockey game simulation.

### 🔹 [Project-09: Focus Guard](./Project-09-FocusGuard)
Monitors user focus/attention using computer vision.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/opencv-projects.git
cd opencv-projects

Navigate to any project folder and run:

python main.py

🛠 Requirements

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


⚠️ Each project may also include its own requirements.txt if it has unique dependencies.

📌 Notes

These projects are primarily for learning and experimenting with Computer Vision.

More projects will be added as I continue exploring OpenCV.

Larger projects will be moved into their own dedicated repositories.
